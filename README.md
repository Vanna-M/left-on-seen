# left-on-seen


A model of the planets orbiting the sun on their proper, ellipsical paths, at proper speeds. Distance between planets not to scale for space-saving sake. Automatic time shift, but also slider on bottom to control orbit time. Slider on side controls date, and rockets launch from earth to other planet on appropriate date in history. Chosen  because space is cool.
